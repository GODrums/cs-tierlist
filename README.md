Tierlists for many pattern-based CS skins. The list of supported skins and weapons is listed below.

This repository contains pre-generated tierlists in the `generated` folder and a [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cs-tierlist) package as small wrapper for quick and simple usage in JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

## üì¶ Credits

This repository is only a public data collection.
I did not create the tierlists myself, credit goes to their original creators.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### JavaScript/TypeScript (NPM)

Install the latest version as [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cs-tierlist) package:
```js
npm install cs-tierlist
```

Use the package in your own project and only import what you actually need:
```js
// import the desired package
const { CrimsonM9Mapping, CyanbitKarambitMapping } = require("cs-tierlist");

// Get the pattern for a specific seed
const pattern2 = CrimsonM9Mapping.getPattern(2);

// Get the all patterns
const patterns = CyanbitKarambitMapping.getAllPatterns();
```

### Other languages

This repository contains pre-generated tierlists in the `generated` folder.
For example, the tierlist for the `M9 Bayonet` knives is located at `generated/crimson_web_m9.json`. Github provides raw links for each file in the repository without CORS restrictions.

Example in Python:
```python
# import the requests library
import requests

# download the tierlist
m9_cw_tierlist = requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/godrums/cs-tierlist/main/generated/crimson_web_m9.json").json()

# get the pattern for a specific seed
pattern2 = m9_cw_tierlist["2"]
```

## üóé Raw Tierlist Format

When using the raw JSON-files, the format is as follows:

```typescript
{
    [paint_seed: string]: {
        img?: string, // Optional Steam URL to the image
        type: string, // Type of the tier, e.g. "Double Web"
        tier: number, // Tier of the pattern, e.g. 1
        rank?: number, // Optional Rank of the pattern, e.g. 1
    }
}
```

Please make sure to follow the existing structure and use the same format for the tierlists.

For new tierlists, it is required to submit at least one test-file under `__tests__\modules` for each tierlist and to include the test results in the pull request.
